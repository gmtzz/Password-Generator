# Description 
This password generator app uses HTML and CSS to randomly generate passwords with special characters, upper and lowercase characters, and a length between 8 and 128 characters. This app aids users in creating a password with complexities for emails, web accounts, etc. 
# Process for App Deployment
For Password Generator I used Javascript to make dynamic changes to the corresponding HTML document. 
# How does it work?
First the app is displayed in an HTML document that has the purpose of generating a random password. 
* Once the user navigates to the "generate password" button, they are prompted to enter a number of characters between 8-128.
*  If the user inputs a character less than 8 or greater than 128, the page will notify them to enter a valid number. 
* Once the user enters a valid number, they will be asked if they want special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters.
* Once the user clicks "OK" to all these password requirements, a unique random password will be generated for their use.
